# enum4linux-ng
Danger ahead: This tool is currently in beta phase.

enum4linux-ng.py is a rewrite of enum4linux.pl. 
I mainly made the tool for eductional purposes for myself and tried to implement everything I was missing from the original tool.

Features:
- support for YAML and JSON (pre-parsed output)
- colored console output
- ldapsearch und polenum are natively implemented

If you use the tool: Please, don't use it for illegal purposes.
